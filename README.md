# CSCI 5481 Final project (Group 22)

## Group members
+ Hmong Moua (`moua0390`)
+ Parsa Moradi (`moradi`)

## Notes
+ Quality trimming and filtering is performed on raw shotgun sequencing data for the SARS-CoV2 spike protein (`sars_spike_protein_raw_reads.fastq`) using Trimmomatic. This can be performed by running the commands in `trim_reads.sh`.
+ FastQC can be used to view the quality of the data before and after trimming. This can be performed by running the commands in `run_fastqc.sh`.
